    <h2>CONCEPT</h2>
    <text>The concept for our ISP was to make a simple interactive game of Tic Tac Toe. The general idea was to draw the grid and create an algorithm to check for win conditions at the end of every turn.</text>

    <h2>MOTIVATION</h2>
    <text>The motivation for our ISP was to make a simple game that everyone for the most part, already knew how to play. The game we decided on was TicTacToe.</text>

    <h2>CODE</h2>

    <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
    <text>The conclusions I drew from doing this ISP project is that working in a group all collaborating on the same files is pretty difficult for out-of-class work.<br>
      I also just generally learned a lot more about how to code more complex programs from the ground up as opposed to following assignment instructions.<br>
      It was definitely a challenge to get done, between the general coding process to technology challenges, but I think it turned out pretty good in the end.<br></text>
