    <h1>My Digital Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>About Me:</h2>

    <p>Hello, my name is Helen Giordano and I am in the Computer Science 2 class. This is my digital portfolio documenting my experiences in computer science.</p>
    <p>I got into coding and technology from a really young age as my dad owned a tech-realted business, so I was exposed to a lot of computer stuff.</p>
    <p>I've lived in Allen for my entire life, but I went between schools growing up, from going to a Montessori school, to a small and crappy private school that we later found out was an actual Ponzi scheme, before ending up in the AllenISD school system.</p>
    <p>I guess what I learned from having a wide variety of educational experiences is that there were a lot of things that i'd yet to learn, and certain things I needed to unlearn.</p>
    <p>As well as having general programming experience for a long time, I got briefly involved in game design and have made some questionablly functional games which are now buried somewhere in my old hard drives.</p>
    
    <h2> Importance </h2>
    <p>This digital portfolio is important to me because its a centralized space where I can keep all my computer science achievements and projects so I can see them and keep learning from them. It's a place where I can display and track my progress across my computer science career and gives me the opportunity to look back and how i've improved throughout the years. It can be a valuable resource to show for potential job applications</p>
