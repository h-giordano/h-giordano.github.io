      Secure internet websites are extremely important in the 21st century, with cyber security protocols constantly evolving to keep websites safe. Unfortunately, not even the most secure measures are 100% safe for users. This is where HTTPS, or secure, connections, were born. HTTP websites were the standard because they were cheaper, and the more secure connections (HTTPS) were really only found in higher level webpages. This has changed, and now more and more websites are defaulting to this safer connection. Two primary purposes of a secure, HTTPS connection are to protect the user’s personal information and to encrypt any traffic going through it. But this can be bypassed by an HTTPS Proxy Appliance, which is a fraudulent appliance that essentially bypasses the secure HTTPS connection and creates a fake server certificate in order to do so. This is only one way in which an attacker can bypass security measures. Another way is whats known as a MITM, or Man in the Middle, attack. This is when a person is acting as a middle-man in between a user and application. The goal of these attackers is to gain personal information and to appear as if it’s a normal exchange of information. One security measure that is taken to help prevent this is a cryptographic hash. This is essentially a digital fingerprint that can be compared to fraudulent security certificates in order to detect breaches in security. Another security measure is a CA, or a Certificate Authority, which is an entity that verifies websites and generally acts as a trusted validation tool to detect if there are any issues with digital security. However, even with these tools, SSL interception can’t be completely prevented, but it can be detected as no fake security certificate is 100% undetectable. Security certificates, no matter how well-faked they are, are never identical to the real digital fingerprints. One issue that can arise from all these measures are false-positives. These are typically found under larger websites, where multiple security certificates are used for convenience. This, while a completely valid security measure, can lead to false-positive mismatches if a user’s security certificate is compared to one of the valid ones, and it doesn’t match even though they have received another valid certificate, just not the one it was checked against. False-negatives are the exact opposite, where a fraudulent certificate isn’t detected and is let through. I personally don’t think schools or governments have the right to access your online activity. Even if it is technically legal, it is an unethical invasion of privacy.
