    <text>Hello, my name is Helen Giordano and I am in the Computer Science 2 class. This is my digital portfolio documenting my experiences in computer science.<br>
      I got into coding and technology from a really young age as my dad owned a tech-realted business, so I was exposed to a lot of computer stuff.<br>
      I've lived in Allen for my entire life, but I went between schools growing up, from going to a Montessori school, to a small private school that we later found out was mainly a front for the owner's ponzi scheme, before ending up in the AllenISD school system.<br>
      I guess what I learned from having a wide variety of educational experiences is that there were a lot of things that i'd yet to learn, and certain things I needed to unlearn.<br>
      As well as having general programming experience for a long time, I got briefly involved in game design and have made some questionably functional games which are now buried somewhere in my old hard drives.<br></text>
